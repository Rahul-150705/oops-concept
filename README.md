Day-by-Day Plan
Class & Object Basics – Syntax, fields, methods, creating objects.

Instance Variables & Methods – Access via object, differences from local variables.

Constructors (Default & Parameterized) – Definition, rules, usage.

Constructor Overloading + Copy Constructor – Multiple constructors, copying object values.

this Keyword (Basic Uses) – Resolving variable shadowing, constructor chaining.

static Keyword – Static variables, static methods, static blocks.

Review + Mini Project – BankAccount class with deposit/withdraw.

Access Modifiers – private, default, protected, public.

Encapsulation – Getters & setters, why fields should be private.

Inheritance Basics – extends keyword, single inheritance.

Multilevel + Hierarchical Inheritance – Chaining multiple levels.

super Keyword – Access parent members & constructors.

Method Overriding – Runtime polymorphism basics.

Review + Mini Project – Employee management system.

Method Overloading – Compile-time polymorphism.

Runtime Polymorphism – Dynamic method dispatch & upcasting.

Abstract Classes – Abstract methods & partial abstraction.

Interfaces – Multiple inheritance & contracts.

Default & Static Methods in Interfaces – Java 8+ features.

final Keyword – Constants, preventing overriding & inheritance.

Review + Mini Project – Ride-hailing system.

Inner & Nested Classes – Non-static inner, static nested, local inner classes.

Object Class Methods – toString(), equals(), hashCode().

Wrapper Classes + Autoboxing/Unboxing – Primitive ↔ Object conversions.

instanceof Operator – Runtime type checking.

Packages – Creating and importing user-defined packages.

Exception Handling Basics – try, catch, finally, throw, throws.

Custom Exceptions – Creating your own exception classes.

OOP Principles – DRY, SRP, cohesion & coupling basics.

Final Review + Project – Library Management System.
